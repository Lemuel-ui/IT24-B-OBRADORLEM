               <p>Hello Kitty, created by the Japanese company Sanrio, made her debut in 1974. Designed by Yuko Shimizu, she was initially featured on a vinyl coin purse. The character quickly gained popularity, leading to a wide range of products, from stationery to clothing.

                Hello Kitty is characterized as a cute, anthropomorphic cat with a simple design—she has no mouth, which allows fans to project their emotions onto her. Over the years, she has become a cultural icon, known for her friendly personality and love for friendship.
                
                Her appeal transcends age, making her beloved worldwide. In the 1980s and 1990s, Hello Kitty became a staple in pop culture, leading to collaborations with various brands and appearances in media. Today, she continues to evolve, appealing to new generations while maintaining her classic charm.</p>
